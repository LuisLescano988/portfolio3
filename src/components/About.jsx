            Hi, my name is Luigi and I am a highly ambitious,
            self-motivated, and driven Full stack developer
            based in Santiago del Estero, Argentina. <br /> I graduated
            from Henry Bootcamp, in 2021 with more than 900
            hours of code and have been working in the field ever since.
            I have a lot of hobbies and passions that keep me busy.
            From playing with my dogs and cats, playing sports,
            cooking for mates, to mentoring friends to learn programming,
            I am always seeking new experiences and love to stay engaged
            with projects and learning new technologies. <br /> My goal is to
            never stop being curious because it drives me to be a good
            learner. I combine that with my passion for technology and my
            desire to always go beyond the limits, imagining solutions
            or projects that have a significant impact on companies. ðŸ¤“
